I am a highly adaptable creative with over 200 completed projects. Whether that be video editing, designing still graphics or motion graphics, down to operating a camera, it doesnâ€™t matter, I can step up to any creative role and adapt to different workflows and environments with 7+ years of creative experience at an amateur and professional level.
